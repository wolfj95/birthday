# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Node.js project called "birthday" that is currently in its initial setup phase. The project has a package-lock.json file but no package.json or source code yet.

## Project Structure

The repository is minimal and contains:
- `package-lock.json` - NPM lock file (currently empty dependencies)
- `.claude/` - Claude Code configuration directory

## Development Setup

Since this project is in early stages, basic Node.js setup will be needed:

1. Create a `package.json` file to define project dependencies and scripts
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up project structure as needed

## Common Commands

Currently no build, test, or development commands are defined. These will need to be established as the project develops.

## Notes

- Project appears to be a birthday-related application based on the name
- No specific framework or architecture has been established yet
- Development workflow and tooling need to be set up
